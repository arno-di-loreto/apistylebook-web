# API Stylebook's purpose
The API Stylebook aims to help API Designers to solve API design matters or build their API design guidelines by providing quick and easy access to categorized resources.  
In this first version the API Stylebook provides direct links to specific topics within publicly available API Design Guidelines. Instead of reinventing the wheel or roaming google searches for hours, API Designers can find solutions and inspiration from categorized selected materials.

# Why the name API Stylebook
The *API Stylebook* name has been inspired by the *AP Stylebook* which is a writing style guide for journalists published by the Associated Press.
